# react_native_news_app

This is a News Aggregator Mobile Application written in React Native with Expo. This App pulls data from the News API currently, though I also am considering RSS feeds and Wordpress Endpoints for relevant articles there. 

# How to run the App

To run the app, open your terminal and clone this repository then use ```cd react_native_news_app``` and run ```yarn install```. The dependencies should all be installed without any problems.

After installing all the dependencies you may run either ```yarn run android``` to run the Android app and ```yarn run ios``` to run the iOS app.
